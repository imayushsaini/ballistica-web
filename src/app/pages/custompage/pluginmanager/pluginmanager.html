    <h2>Installation Options</h2>
    There are two recommended methods for installing the Bombsquad Plugin
    Manager: <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Recommended Method:</strong> Download the "plugin_manager.py"
        file to your mods directory. Access the mods directory by navigating to
        your game's Settings, then selecting Advanced, and finally clicking on
        Show Mods Folder. This method ensures a seamless installation process.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Alternative Method:</strong> Add the "plugin_manager.py" file to
        your workspace. However, please note that self-updates of the plugin
        manager will not work with this installation method. To manually apply
        updates, simply copy the latest source code of the plugin manager into
        your workspace. It's important to note that this method may lead to
        compatibility issues if the game overwrites the plugin manager during
        the next sync.

    </ul>
