      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>BombSquad is a popular multiplayer game that utilizes a server/client architecture. In this setup, player input
        is
        transmitted to the host server during a network game, which then processes the inputs and sends the results back
        to all
        participating clients. However, to ensure a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience, it is crucial for the
        server
        to
        maintain a lag-free network connection. This article delves into the significance of server performance and
        network
        connection quality in optimizing the multiplayer experience in BombSquad. Right now BombSquad Server can be

            <li>If you using Windows , most probably you also need to configure your Windows firewall for this
              application to allow incoming traffic on game port i.e 43210 (may be different , you will get message what
              port you need to open.)</li>
            <li>Your server is on as long as game is running, once you close game your party will get closed. So this is

          <h3>Host a Private Party | Gather</h3>

            a secret Party Code which you need to share with your friends with whom you want to play.</p>
          Pros
          <ul>
            <li>Game will run on cloud server near your location, so it will run smooth for you and your friend.</li>
            <li>Very cheap , most of the time you will be available to create this party for free , else it will charge

            <li>Usefull in scenario where you just to play with your friends privately.</li>
          </ul>
          Cons

          </ul>
          <hr>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Host a Dedicated Server | Cloud Server</h3>
          <p>This server is not hosted with your game. This Option use headless server scripts.
            For this you may need some technical knowledge to create a server and install game server scripts, also it
            need some extra assets like you phone number and credit card/debit card.
            Hosting on Dedicated Cloud server means you will buy a computer which is running somewhere else and you will
            install BombSquad server scripts on that computer. So definately this is not a free solution
            you need to buy a cloud server also known as instance , virtual machine , droplet , EC2, VPS, some kids call
            it an "IP" which is technically misleading.<br> Dont worry you not need to always pay for this, yipee
            yeah there are some cloud providers (nearly all) they provides free trial with limited resource and time
            period or gives you free credits which you can spend to host a server. But you still need to have a valid
            bank credit card to verify your account to redeem free trial.
            Like you can check out Cloud providers like AWS, they gives 12 Months free trial with t2.micro EC2 instance
            and 100GB of Bandwidth and to create AWS account you need to to have atleast Debit Card and they charge
            small amount of money like 2Rs or 1$ to verify you card. They refunds that amount within 24 hours in same
            bank account.
            If you google "Cloud server with free trial" you will find plenty of websites that offer free trial for some
            duration.</p>
          Pros
          <ul>
            <li>You have complete control on your server, you can customize server scripts, install mods</li>
            <li>This Server will run 24/7, as this is running on some other's computer, not yours.</li>
            <li>You can host this server for free , using free trial from cloud. Create new account after trial expire
              or use some other cloud providers.</li>
          </ul>
          Cons
          <ul>
            <li>You need a valid Credit card/Debit Card , to create Cloud account.</li>
            <li>Some cloud provides free trial for some time duration. But then after trial expire they will start
              charging money.</li>
            <li>You need good technicall skills or have to pay good attention while watching youtube tutorials, and
              follow it properly.</li>
            <li>You need to understand free trial terms condition properly, else you can get huge bill.</li>
            <li>It could be little hard to do , if you doing for first time.</li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Host a Headless Server | On your device</h3>
          <p>This is a combination of option 1 and option 3. In this server will be hosted on your device instead of
            cloud server. But not within you game, it will be hosted with headless server scripts.
            <br>So you not need to keep your game running. As server scripts will be running in background on your
            computer/phone/device.
            But you need to keep your phone/computer powered on as server is running on your device.
          </p>
          Pros <ul>
            <li>Its free to host. Since server is running on you device.</li>
            <li>You can use rasberry pi , old computer or Android device and keep them turned on 24/7 to keep you server
              online.</li>
            <li>You can customize scripts, install mods or modify in what ever way you want.
            <li>
          </ul>
          Cons <ul>
            <li>All cons of option 1, port forwarding, firewall setting, IP address reveal, good internet.</li>
            <li>Additionally you father will get electricity bill, as you keeping your device turned on for long itme.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
