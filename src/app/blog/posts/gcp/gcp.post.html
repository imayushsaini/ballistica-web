      <h2>How to open server with Google Cloud ?</h2>
      <p>Google Cloud is a collection of online services provided by Google. These services
        allow businesses and individuals to store data, run programs, and use advanced
        technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, all over the internet instead
        of on their own computers. It's like renting a powerful computer and software from
        Google, so you can do your work or run your apps more easily and efficiently.</p>
      <h2>Requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Valid bank card (for validity or else their system won’t allow you to create Google
          Cloud account)</li>
        <li>Putty (to create a ssh key, which you’ll need for accessing your server)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Refer to this article, to create your own ssh key!
            </li>
            <li>keep in mind, ssh key can be generated other ways too (search on google!)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Winscp = preferred for windows users</li>
        <li>Android:
          Cx File Manager (to access files on your server)
          JuiceSSH (to access your server through terminal)</li>
        <li>Cyberduck = for Mac OS users</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a google account, and then proceed to google cloud
          Google Cloud Tutorial 2
          In Google Cloud, follow the steps of creating account, along with valid credit
          card</li>
        <li>
          After creating a account, this is what you’ll see
          <img src="" alt="">
          As you can see, the red shows how much credits you have left (you are given
          $300 free credits) and the blue shows for how long your trial lasts (91 days = 3
          months free service).
          Keep in mind, if one them (credit or days) run out (expire), then your services
          will stop and you cannot access your clouds! You will have to change to paid
          plan, to be able to access your services again. So make sure to backup your
          data before trial is about to run out!
